 Perfect! I've successfully updated your finance app. Here's what I did:

  1. OTP Parser Improvements (otp_parser.py)

  Updated the parser to correctly handle dobro (credit) and breme (debit) columns:

  - Modified regex pattern to capture both dobro and breme columns separately
  - Added sign logic:
    - Transactions in the dobro column get a + (positive) sign
    - Transactions in the breme column get a - (negative) sign
  - Enhanced data storage: Now stores DobroRaw, BremeRaw, AmountSign fields for complete transparency
  - Correct amount calculation: The Amount field now correctly reflects positive values for income and negative
  values for expenses

  2. Brutalist Design Overhaul

  Transformed all HTML pages with a brutalist aesthetic:

  Key Design Elements:

  - Monospace font: Courier New for that raw, technical feel
  - Black & white color scheme: High contrast, no gradients or soft colors
  - Thick borders: 5px solid black borders on all major elements, 3px on smaller ones
  - No rounded corners: Everything is sharp and angular
  - Bold typography: 900 weight, uppercase headings with tight letter-spacing
  - No shadows or blur effects: Clean, flat design
  - Blocky layouts: Simple grid and flex layouts
  - Raw form elements: Heavy borders, monospace fonts
  - Chart styling (dashboard): Thick lines, no curves, monospace labels

  Updated Files:

  - templates/dashboard.html - Dashboard with brutalist chart styling
  - templates/transactions.html - Transaction list with brutal table design
  - templates/categories.html - Category management with stark forms

  The design now has that characteristic brutalist vibe: unapologetic, functional, and visually striking with its
  raw, industrial aesthetic.
